    <h3 translate>How this web-site came into being</h3>
    <p translate>It all started with computer programming project as part of one our courses. This led to a prototypic solution created by the following students:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Amir Basyouni</li>
        <li>Mercedes Stibler</li>
        <li>Stephan Vrecer</li>
    </ul>
    <p translate>This solution was the basis for the now available site</p>
    <p><span translate>After winning a</span> <a href="https://www.netidee.at">netidee</a>-<span translate>grant for the year 2015, the site developed further. With the help of the following students new features were added:</span></p>
    <ul>
