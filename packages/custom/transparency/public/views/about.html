        Background
    </h2>

    <p translate>
        As a consequence of ongoing discussions about potential misuse of tax-payers' money spent in advertising, the Austrian Parliament has released the so called Media Transparency Act ("Bundesverfassungsgesetz über die Transparenz von Medienkooperationen sowie von Werbeaufträgen und Förderungen an Medieninhaber eines periodischen Mediums und das KommAustria-Gesetz") in 2011. This regulation requires certain organizations to quarterly report on their spending in advertising and funding of media cooperations. Reported data is published by the <a href="http://www.rtr.at"> Rundfunk und Telekom Regulierungs GesmbH</a>. This web-site tries to provide an easy-to-use interface to this very data so that all interested citizens are able to get the information relevant to them out of it.

        Thus, this web-site wants to contribute to making Open Government Data more popular in Austrian</p>
